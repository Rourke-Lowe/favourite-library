      "description": "We were thrilled to introduce the Common Ground series. This new series took place outdoors and was all about connecting with ourselves and others. Before and after the event, trained meditation & breath-work facilitator Selma Kihal led a 5-10 minute optional grounding meditation. Everyone was loose and comfy, and then enjoyed three artistic projects sharing their work on a very comfortable secluded back patio. The artists who performed for Common Ground 01 were: 1. Oscar Louis with Chris Vincent 2. Charlie Houston 3. Anna Justen Guests brought picnic blankets and many came with journals to write or draw in, or objects they wanted to recharge with the joyful and peaceful energies evoked by the sounds. Doors opened at 6pm with the show starting at 7pm.",
